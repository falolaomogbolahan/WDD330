<h2>Notes</h2>

<h3>Tranforms and Transitions</h3>
<p>
    The CSS3 transform property allows you translate, rotate, scale, and/or skew an element on the page.
    While some of these effects were possible using previously
existing CSS features (such as translating with relative and absolute positioning),
CSS3 gives you unprecedented control over many more aspects of the element’s
appearance.
An elements appearance can be manipulated using transform functions.

<h3>Transitions</h3>
<p>
    Translation functions allow you to move elements left, right, up, or down. These
functions are similar to the behavior of position: relative; when declaring top
and left, moving elements up and down or left and right along the x and y axes.
When you employ a translation function, you’re moving elements without impacting
the flow of the document. Unlike position: relative, which allows you to position
an element either against its current position or against a parent or other ancestor,
a translated element can only be moved relative to its current position

    <h3> Canvas SVG, and Drag and Drop </h3>
<h4>Canvas</h4>
<p> HTML5's Canvas API permits us to be able to draw anything we can imagine, all trough Jvcascript,this improve the speed and performance of our website becauser it wouldn't need to download images of the network.
