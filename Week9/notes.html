<h2>Notes</h2>

<h3>The Browser Object Model</h3>
<p> The Browser Object Model (or BOM for Short) is a collection of properties and methods that contain information about the browser and computer screen. For example, we can find out which browser is being used to view a page.
    alert, confirm(), and prompt() are all methods of the window object and open dialogs that halt the execution of the program. 
    The window.navigator object gives information about the user's brpwer and operationg system, although it can be unreliable. 
</p> 

<h3>HTML5 APIs</h3>
<p>
HTML5 is the latest version of the Hypertext Markup Language used to create web pages. 
The Web Storage API provides a key-value store on the clients's computer that is similar to using cookies but has fewwer retrictions, more storage capacity, and is generally easier to use. This makes it perfect for the storing informations about users, as well as storing application-specific information that can then be used during future sessions. 

The Geolocation API allows to access the goeographic coordinsted of the user's device,as long as the user gives permission. 

A Notification API allows you to display notifications on the user's system.
