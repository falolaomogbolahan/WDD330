<h1> Testing and Debugging, Week 5 </h1>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>
        This week i studied about testing and debugging in Javascript. Debugging is the process of testing, finding, and reducing bugs (errors) in computer programs. Errors are caused when something goes wrong in a program, There are different
        types of errors, and they are usually caused by the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>System errors - there's a problem with the system or external devices with which the program is interacting.</li>
        <li>Programmer error - the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic.</li>
        <li>User error - a data was entered incorrectly, which the program cant recognise.</li>
    </ul> 
    <p>
    It's important to be able to recognize what errors we have so that we can properly
    test and debug them.
    </p>
    <h4>Console.log()</h4>
    <p>
    One debugging method is <i>console.log()</i>. Using this allows us to display a value in
    the console so we can see what value is being calaculated and can see if it's our desired outcome.</p>
    <p>
        <i>Example from w3school</i>
    a = 5; <br>
    b = 6; <br>
    c = a + b; <br>
    console.log(c); <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    By doing this we will see that c is equal to 11 and and know whether or not our program is working
    correctly.
    </p>
    <h3>Breakpoints</h3>
    <p> In the debugger window, you can set breakpoints in the JavaScript code.
        At each breakpoint, JavaScript will stop executing, and let you examine JavaScript values.
        After examining values, you can resume the execution of code (typically with a play button).
    </p>
    <h3>Debugger Keyword</h3>
    <p>
    The <i>debugger</i> keyword is similar to settting a breakpoint. It stops the execution of
    the program where it is placed before continuing.
    </p>
    <p>
    var x = 15 * 5; <br>
    debugger; <br>
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;

    <p> you can activate debugging in your browser with F12, and select "Console" in the debugger menu.
