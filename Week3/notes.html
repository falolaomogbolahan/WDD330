<h1> Objects, Week 3 </h1>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>
        This week I studied objects, properties and methods, Objects are said to be a seld-conatined set of functions and related values. it is used to keep any related information and functionality together in one place.
    </p>
<p> Objects are variables, but they can contain many values. each variables are seperated by a comma, and all its properties are
wrapped in curly braces, 

Behold a simple example  
    </p>

    <p>
        const metahuman = {type:"villain", Power:"Invisibilty", name:"trans"};
    </p>
    Each property is a key-value pair, seperated by commas and the values can be accessed by simply typing <i>metahuman.name</i>.
    this would target the name of the metahuman and the variable would be trans.
    it can also be accessed using the square bracket notation, <i>metahuman ['name']</i>. the same thing would happen. 
    <p>
        <p>IF YOU TRY TO ACCESS A PROPERTY THAT DOESNT  EXIST, <i>undefined</i> will be returned.</p>
    <p>
        The <i>in</i> operator can be used to check wheather an object has a particular property, 
    </p>
