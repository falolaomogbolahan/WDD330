<h2>Notes</h2>

<h3>Further Functions</h3>
<p>
          Futher functions are first-objects that have properties and methods themselves, for example all functions have a <i>Length</i> propert that returns the number of parameters the funtion has. 
          <b><i>EXAMPLE</i></b> <br>
          function square(x) {
              return x*x; 
          }   
square.length 
... 1 
<hr>
<b><p>Call and Apply Methods </p></b>
This can be used to set value of <i>this</i> inside a function to an object that is provided as the first argument.



<b><p>Immediately Invoked Function Expressions</p></b>
This are functions that are enclosed in parentheses and immediately followed by double parentheses so they're invoked. they are useful for namespacing variables and setting default values. 
    </p>
<hr>
    <p> Functions that return other functions are known as higher-order functions </p>
    <p>Functional programming involves breaking processes down into steps that can be applied as a series of functions</p>
    <p>Functions are able to dyna,ically redefine themselves in the body of the body of te funcuion, depending on certain conditions. </p>
<h3>Ajax</h3>
<p>Ajax is a technique that allows wb pages tocommunicate asynchronously with a server, and it dynamically updates web pags without reloading. this enables data to be sent and received in the background as well as portions of a page to be updated in response to user events, while the rest of the program continues to run.  </p>
<p>The data can be sent in many forms, but its usually in JSON. </p>    
<p>Ajax can be used for making partial page udates without having to do a full page reload.</p>
<p>Ajax can be used fo communicating with extenal APIs, it can also be used to fetch API.</p>
