<p> Forms are the primary methood used for entering data into a browser.
    Forms are made up of <i><form></i> element that contains form controls like input fields, select menus and buttons. 
    each form control hads an initial value that is found in the HTML code, the value can be change using Javascriptor by etering informationor interacting with the form's interface. 
    A simple example of a form that contains one input field is shown below,

    <i>
        <!doctype html> 
        <html lang='en'>
            <head>
                <meta charset='utf-8'>
                <title>Search</title>
            </head>
            <form name='search' action='/search'>
                <input name='searchInput'>
                <button type='submit'> Search </button>
            </form>
            
    </i>

<p> Object Oriented Programming "OOP" is a way of programming that uses objects that encapsulate their own properties and methods. </p>
<p>In Object-oriented Programmming there are three main concepts.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Encapsulation - Parts of the program are inside objects
                and only essential functionalities are exposed to the end user.
            </li>
            <li>
                Polymorphism - The same process can be used for different objects.
                Various objects can be used for the same method.
            </li>
            <li>
                Inheritance - You can take an object that already exists and Inherit
                all its properties and methods.
            </li>
        </ol>
